A boilerplate that includes HTML5 BP, Grunt, and assemble IO for static sites.

TODO:
* Setup concatenation tasks for vendor provided JS.
* Find what is cause my data folder to be ignored.
* Setup test folder for test assets aside from templates.
* Keep docs from BP5 in place until we handle the defaults.

STATE: Currently working.
LEARNED: Grunt needs package files read in at the top level in grunt file not read in on individual task files.

Files that are still using BP5 Defaults.
* Server side files
* XML configs
* JS provided from BP5
* Error pages
* Editor configurations
* Anything referencing icons or OS tiles.
